# holbertonschool-low_level_programming

Low-level programming projects in C completed as part of the Holberton School curriculum.  
This repository groups multiple small projects that build a foundation in syntax, memory, data structures, file I/O, and system-level concepts.

## Directory structure

Current project directories in this repository:

- `argc_argv/` – Programs that use command-line arguments (`argc` and `argv`)
- `doubly_linked_lists/` – Implementation and manipulation of doubly linked lists
- `file_io/` – File input/output using POSIX system calls
- `function_pointers/` – Using and implementing function pointers
- `functions_nested_loops/` – Functions, nested loops, and basic utilities
- `hash_tables/` – Hash table data structure and related operations
- `hello_world/` – First C programs, compilation scripts, and basic output
- `malloc_free/` – Dynamic memory allocation with `malloc` and `free`
- `more_functions_nested_loops/` – More practice with functions and nested loops
- `more_malloc_free/` – Additional exercises with dynamic memory allocation
- `pointers_arrays_strings/` – Pointer arithmetic, arrays, and string handling
- `recursion/` – Solving problems using recursive functions
- `singly_linked_lists/` – Definition and basic operations on singly linked lists
- `structures_typedef/` – Working with `struct` and `typedef`
- `variables_if_else_while/` – Variables, conditionals, loops, and control flow
- `variadic_functions/` – Functions with a variable number of arguments

Each directory contains its own `README.md` (when present) together with source files, headers, and sometimes test `main.c` files.

## Requirements

- Language: C
- Compiler: `gcc`
- Recommended flags: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic`
- Style: Holberton/Betty style guidelines

Some projects may define additional requirements or specific compile commands in their own directory README.

## How to use this repository

1. Clone the repository:
```https://github.com/sokolgj19/holbertonschool-low_level_programming```
```cd holbertonschool-low_level_programming```

2. Enter a project directory, for example:
```cd functions_nested_loops```

3. Compile the C files as required for the specific task, for example:
```gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o my_program```

4. Run the resulting executable:
```./my_program```

For detailed information about a specific topic (e.g. linked lists, recursion, file I/O), open that directory and read its `README.md` and source files.
