# More malloc and free

## Description

Follow-up dynamic memory allocation tasks that work with variable-size strings and integer ranges.

## Key concepts

- Checked allocation helpers that exit on failure
- Concatenating strings with size limits
- Zero-initialized memory (calloc-style behavior)
- Building arrays over a range of integers on the heap
