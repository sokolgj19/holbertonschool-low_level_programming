# Hash tables

## Description

Implementation of a basic hash table in C with separate functions to create, insert, retrieve, print, and delete entries.

## Key concepts

- Hash functions (like `djb2`) and index computation
- Collisions and handling them with linked lists
- Storing key–value pairs in a table
- Proper memory cleanup for the whole hash table
