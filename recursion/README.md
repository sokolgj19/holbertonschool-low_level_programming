# Recursion

## Description

Functions that use recursion instead of loops to solve problems like string length, factorial, powers, and primality.

## Key concepts

- Writing recursive functions with clear base and recursive cases
- Recursively traversing strings
- Computing factorial, power, and square root
- Checking prime numbers using recursion
